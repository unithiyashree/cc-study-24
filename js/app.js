The study includes ten tasks in total—four designed to assess cognition, four to measure perception, and two to examine abstract reasoning. This work contributes to the growing body of cross-cultural research by examining how culture shapes fundamental aspects of cognition and perception. Previous studies have often compared Western countries (e.g., the U.S., the UK) with East Asian countries (e.g., China, Japan). Broadly, Western cultures are described as more individualistic, while East Asian cultures are considered more collectivistic. Despite being one of the largest countries in Asia, there is limited research on the cultural influences shaping various psychological phenomena in India. Studying India is important because it represents a unique cultural context influenced by both collectivistic and individualistic styles. Including people from India and from Indian-heritage backgrounds in cross-cultural research allows us to test whether well-documented psychological patterns generalize beyond East Asia and the West. </p><p>One of the tasks used in this study is Ebbinghaus Illusions, a visual perception task. In this task, the two orange circles are flanked by a grid of eight gray circles, which are all smaller or larger than the center orange circle. The illusion occurs because the orange circles appear larger when flanked by smaller gray circles, leading to distortions in comparing the sizes of the two orange circles with differing contexts (i.e., small or large flankers). Prior findings suggest that East Asian participants, who are generally more sensitive to context, tend to experience the illusion more strongly, whereas Western participants are somewhat less affected by the surrounding context. By including this task, the study investigates whether Indian participants show context sensitivity more like East Asians or whether their responses align more closely with Western participants. </p><p>Through these tasks, the study aims to provide a clearer picture of how culture shapes cognition and perception across a broader cross-cultural population than previously studied.

The study includes ten tasks in total—four designed to assess cognition, four to measure perception, and two to examine abstract reasoning. This work contributes to the growing body of cross-cultural research by examining how culture shapes fundamental aspects of cognition and perception. Previous studies have often compared Western countries (e.g., the U.S., the UK) with East Asian countries (e.g., China, Japan). Broadly, Western cultures are described as more individualistic, while East Asian cultures are considered more collectivistic. Despite being one of the largest countries in Asia, there is limited research on the cultural influences shaping various psychological phenomena in India. Studying India is important because it represents a unique cultural context influenced by both collectivistic and individualistic styles. Including people from India and from Indian-heritage backgrounds in cross-cultural research allows us to test whether well-documented psychological patterns generalize beyond East Asia and the West. </p><p>One of the tasks used in this study is Ebbinghaus Illusions, a visual perception task. In this task, the two orange circles are flanked by a grid of eight gray circles, which are all smaller or larger than the center orange circle. The illusion occurs because the orange circles appear larger when flanked by smaller gray circles, leading to distortions in comparing the sizes of the two orange circles with differing contexts (i.e., small or large flankers). Prior findings suggest that East Asian participants, who are generally more sensitive to context, tend to experience the illusion more strongly, whereas Western participants are somewhat less affected by the surrounding context. By including this task, the study investigates whether Indian participants show context sensitivity more like East Asians or whether their responses align more closely with Western participants. </p><p>Through these tasks, the study aims to provide a clearer picture of how culture shapes cognition and perception across a broader cross-cultural population than previously studied.
